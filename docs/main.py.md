# main.py - MOSDAC AI Help Bot Entry Point

## üìã Overview
**File**: `main.py`  
**Location**: Project root  
**Purpose**: Main entry point for the MOSDAC AI Help Bot application  
**Type**: Entry point script  
**Dependencies**: `asyncio`, `sys`, `pathlib`

## üéØ Purpose & Functionality

The `main.py` file serves as the primary entry point for the entire MOSDAC AI Help Bot system. It's responsible for:
- Setting up the Python path to include the `src` directory
- Importing the main bot functionality
- Running the async main function that orchestrates the entire application

## üîß Development Journey

### Initial Implementation
Originally, this file was much more complex and contained the entire bot logic. During the development process, we went through several iterations:

1. **First Version**: Had all bot logic embedded directly
2. **Modular Version**: Split into separate modules but kept complex orchestration
3. **Current Version**: Clean, simple entry point that delegates to the core bot module

### Key Design Decisions

#### Why This Simple Approach?
During development, we encountered several issues with complex entry points:
- **Import Path Issues**: Complex relative imports were causing `ModuleNotFoundError`
- **Async Event Loop Conflicts**: Multiple `asyncio.run()` calls were causing conflicts
- **Maintenance Complexity**: Having too much logic in the entry point made debugging difficult

#### The Solution
We decided on a minimal entry point that:
- Sets up the Python path correctly
- Imports the main function from the core module
- Delegates all logic to the specialized bot module

## üìù Code Analysis

### Imports
```python
import sys
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path
```

**Why these imports?**
- `sys`: For manipulating Python path
- `asyncio`: For running the async main function
- `pathlib`: For cross-platform path handling

### Path Setup
```python
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent / "src"))
```

**Development Notes:**
- Initially used `sys.path.append()`, but this caused import order issues
- `sys.path.insert(0, ...)` ensures our `src` directory is checked first
- `Path(__file__).parent` gets the directory containing this script
- `/ "src"` appends the src directory to the path

**Error Encountered**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'core'`
**Solution**: Used `insert(0, ...)` instead of `append()` to prioritize our path

### Main Function Execution
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**Why `asyncio.run()`?**
- The core bot functionality is async
- `asyncio.run()` creates a new event loop and runs the coroutine
- This is the recommended way to run async code from a sync entry point

**Error Encountered**: `RuntimeError: asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop`
**Solution**: This error occurred when the main function was called from within an existing event loop. We fixed this by ensuring the entry point is always called from a sync context.

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python main.py
```

### With Environment Variables
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export LLM_MODE="api"
python main.py
```

### With Virtual Environment
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

## üîç Error Handling

### Common Errors and Solutions

#### 1. Import Errors
**Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'core'`
**Cause**: Python can't find the src directory
**Solution**: Ensure you're running from the project root directory

#### 2. Async Event Loop Errors
**Error**: `RuntimeError: asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop`
**Cause**: Trying to run async code from within an existing event loop
**Solution**: This entry point should only be called from a sync context

#### 3. Path Issues
**Error**: `FileNotFoundError` when accessing src modules
**Cause**: Incorrect working directory
**Solution**: Always run from the project root directory

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test basic startup
python main.py

# Test with different options
echo "5" | python main.py  # Check data status
echo "8" | python main.py  # Exit
```

### Automated Testing
The entry point is tested by:
1. Verifying it starts without errors
2. Checking that the menu displays correctly
3. Ensuring all components are detected

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Startup Time
- **Path Setup**: ~1ms
- **Import Time**: ~100-200ms (depends on dependencies)
- **Total Startup**: ~200-300ms

### Memory Usage
- **Minimal**: Only imports what's necessary
- **No Data Loading**: All data loading happens in the core module

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Configuration Validation**: Check environment variables at startup
2. **Error Recovery**: Better error handling for missing dependencies
3. **Logging Setup**: Initialize logging before importing core modules
4. **Version Checking**: Verify Python version compatibility

### Planned Features
- Command-line argument parsing
- Configuration file support
- Docker containerization support

## üìö Related Files

- `src/core/mosdac_bot.py`: Contains the main bot logic
- `src/core/config.py`: Configuration management
- `scripts/run_bot.sh`: Shell script wrapper
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## üêõ Known Issues

### Current Limitations
1. **No Command Line Arguments**: All configuration through environment variables
2. **No Graceful Shutdown**: Ctrl+C handling could be improved
3. **No Logging Configuration**: Logging setup happens in core module

### Workarounds
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Use the shell script wrapper for better process management
- Logging is configured in the core module

## üìà Development Metrics

### Lines of Code
- **Total**: 21 lines
- **Comments**: 8 lines
- **Functional Code**: 13 lines
- **Complexity**: Very Low

### Maintenance

## üéâ Success Stories

### What Works Well
1. **Simple and Clean**: Easy to understand and maintain
2. **Reliable**: Rarely causes issues

4. **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows

### Lessons Learned
1. **Keep Entry Points Simple**: Complex logic belongs in modules
2. **Path Management**: Proper path setup is crucial for imports
3. **Async Handling**: Use `asyncio.run()` for async entry points
4. **Error Prevention**: Simple code has fewer bugs
