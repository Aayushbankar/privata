AboutDisclaimerCredits AboutDisclaimerCredits
The Space Applications Centre (SAC), has developed a satellite based heavy rainfall alert system using the INSAT series of satellites. These alerts are available in real-time over MOSDAC web portal (www.mosdac.gov.in.). In addition to the heavy rainfall alerts, Cloudburst potential alerts are also provided regularly on MOSDAC for Western Himalayan region using the in-house model Nowcasting of ExTreme orographic RAinfall events (NETRA). At present Heavy rainfall and Cloudburst (Western Himalayan) Alerts are updated every half hourly at every 0.1x0.1-degree grid. 
For further details on (Heavyrain and Cloudburst Nowcast Alerts) refer to the attached document [Description_Alert_heavy_rain.pdf](https://mosdac.gov.in/heavyrain/assets/documents/Description_Alert_heavy_rain.pdf)
