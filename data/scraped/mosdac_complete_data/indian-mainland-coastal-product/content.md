# Indian Mainland Coastal Product 
![SARAL Coastal Product](https://mosdac.gov.in/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/field/image/scoast.png?itok=hvhcIYxy)
SARAL/AltiKa was launched on 25 February 2013 as a joint collaboration mission of ISRO and CNES. With smaller footprint than earlier satellite altimeters, SARAL/AltiKa has improved coastal performance. Specific waveform processing has been used in this product to derive along track geophysical parameters (Sea Surface Height, Significant wave height and wind speed) from the altimeter 40-Hz waveform data. This product is generated for Indian mainland coastal region (up to 50 km from the coast). This product is available for 35 cycles of SARAL/AltiKa starting from March 2013 through July 2016.
### Data Access
[Click Here](https://mosdac.gov.in/opendata/saral_coastal_product/) to access the Science Products . Request to use MOSDAC Single Sign On user credentials to download the data.
### Data Version
  * Version 1.1 (Beta)


### Data Sources
    * Altimeter Sensor-Interim Geophysical Data Record (S-IGDR)
    * Indian Ocean Bathymetry
    * Indian Ocean Geoid
    * High resolution coastline


### Processing Steps
  * i. High resolution bathymetry is used to separate the coastal and land waveforms.
  * ii. Waveforms are classified based on their shape.
  * iii. Waveforms are retracked with the beta parameter retrackers (BETA5 and BETA9) and BAGP (Brown with asymmetric Gaussian Peak) retracker to get sea surface height (SSH), sea surface height anomaly (SSHA), significant wave height (SWH) and wind speed.
  * iv. Using Significant Wave Height (SWH) and wind speed, the wave period is derived based on the data adaptive technique of &quot; Genetic Algorithm &quot; (Remya et al. 2011)
  * v. Wave power is derived based on SWH and estimated wave period. 40 Hz data is filtered using a lanczos filter to remove high frequency noise.
  * vi. Wind power is calculated using standard wind power formula. 40 Hz data is filtered using a lanczos filter to remove high frequency noise.

6 | Abstract | SARAL, a joint ISRO-CNES satellite mission, was successfully launched in 2013. It carries a Ka band single frequency satellite altimeter (AltiKa). Satellite altimeters are primarily used to study sea level changes. In the open ocean, the altimetric echo follows a standard shape, with steeply rising leading edge followed by a trailing edge with gradually diminishing power. This standard shape is in agreement with the theoretical Brown model and hence can be easily modeled. However, in the coastal areas, due to the presence of land and other coastal featues in the footprint of the altimeter, contamination occurs and the return is different from open ocean. Up to some extent these contaminations can be modeled. Footprint size of SARAL/Altika is small which is ideal for coastal studies. The available ocean retracker (MLE4) itself shows good performance near the coast. However, further improvemnts can be achieved by using algorithms which can simulate contaminations impact in the coastal areas. In this document we have used various models for the return waveforms at 40 Hz to extract maximum information from the altimeter. Our results show that algorithms which are useful in the coastal areas are BETA5, BETA9 and Brown with Asymmetric Gaussian Peak (BAGP). Additionally, a wind power and wave power product has also been generated from this coastal product.
