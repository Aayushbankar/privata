        "Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the important processes in the terrestrial water cycle. About 65% of rainwater is lost to the atmosphere due to the combined processes of evaporation and transpiration. In a given climate, reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is defined as the maximum evaporative demand of the atmosphere from a well-watered surface independent of crop type, crop development, and management practice.",
