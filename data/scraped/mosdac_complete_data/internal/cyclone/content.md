AboutDisclaimerCredits AboutDisclaimerCredits
SCORPIO (Satellite Based Cyclone Observation and Real-time Prediction over Indian Ocean) is a WebGIS based Cyclone Information System. Accurate and timely advance prediction of tropical cyclones is very important to disseminate the warnings and preparedness. Prediction of development of any cyclone system in the North Indian Ocean is being done at Space Applications Centre (ISRO) Ahmedabad, using the in-house developed algorithms. Once the low-pressure system is formed, it is continuously monitored by satellite observations. The forecasts like cyclogenesis, track, intensity and landfall of cyclones, ship avoidance region, storm surge, coastal inundation etc. and satellite based cyclone information are disseminated through web-portal SCORPIO. 
This is an experimental forecast. This information is to be used along with other reliable data sources for interpretation.
